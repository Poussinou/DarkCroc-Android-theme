# DarkCroc Android Theme.

A dark theme targeting Android 9.0 or higher, freely adapting the default material dark colors.

Consider this as the continuation of my Default Dark theme series.

With the release of Android 9.0, I wanted to do a fresh start for following reasons:
- It became increasingly difficult to keep support for old platforms (Default Dark was initially created for Android 5 / Lollipop),
    as Substratum doesn't allow a smart overlay selection based on Android version, so I had to provide variants for user selection (ugh, user interaction required!) per app (ugh, more user interaction required!)
- Without the ambition to create a "default" dark theme, I'm more free in theming decisions
- I no longer feel the need to recreate the default Android look in dark (read: I don't like the Android Pie look at all)
- Many custom ROMs now have dark themes already included, so there's not that much of a need for a "default" dark theme (except maybe stock ROM users, which I was never actually targetting with my themes)

Get it on Google Play: when it's ready for release!
